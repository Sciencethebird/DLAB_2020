There is a large setup violation of -5.203 ns between ms_count_reg[4]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and ms_count_reg[4]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#128 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.211 ns between num_cvt_reg[5]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and num_cvt_reg[15]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#129 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.229 ns between ms_count_reg[4]/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and ms_count_reg[7]_replica/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
